# Why I stopped
I quit building this app because I have an iPhone.
The wifi connection must be done using tcp sockets and not websockets.
To use tcp sockets, I would have to use bare react native and not expo.
I don't want to do that. Because I don't have an Apple Developer account or a Mac.

# What I installed
I installed Car Scanner that allows me to fully customize the OBD2 data I want to see and the layout of the data.
